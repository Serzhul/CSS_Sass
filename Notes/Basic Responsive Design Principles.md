# Basic Responsive Design Principles

# 1. Fluid Grids and Layouts

 To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse the website. Uses `%` rather than `px` for all layout-related lengths.

# 2. Flexible/Responsive images

 Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport.

# 3. Media Queries

 To change styles on certain viewport widths(breakpoint), allowing us to create different version of our website for different widths.

# Layout Types

- Float Layouts
- FlxBox
- Css Grid
